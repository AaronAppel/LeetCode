ðŸŸ¨Difficulty

You are given an integer arrayÂ `height`Â of lengthÂ `n`. There areÂ `n`Â vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of theÂ `ith`Â line areÂ `(i, 0)`Â andÂ `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

ReturnÂ _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice**Â that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

My Final Solution :
```cpp live:true file:"11.ContainerWithMostWater.cpp"

#include <assert.h>
#include <vector>

// Link to leetcode problem https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

int ContainerWithMostWater_v1(std::vector<int>&height)
{
	return 0;
}

typedef int(*SolutionFuncPtr)(std::vector<int>&);

void main_ContainerWithMostWater()
{
	SolutionFuncPtr solutionFunc = ContainerWithMostWater_v1;
	// assert(solutionFunc() == true);
}

int main() { main_ContainerWithMostWater(); }

```
