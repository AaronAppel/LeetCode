ðŸŸ¨Medium

You are given twoÂ **non-empty**Â linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored inÂ **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
**Output:** [7,0,8]
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
**Output:** [0]

**Example 3:**
**Input:** l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
**Output:** [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the rangeÂ `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

My Final Solution :
```cpp
// Complexity O(n), Memory O(n)
// Submitted Jan 12 2024 1:30pm
// Runtime#1 of 20ms (71.31%), with RAM usage of 71.87MB (25.62%)
// Runtime#2 of 11ms (97.77%), with RAM usage of 71.69MB (87.26%)
ListNode* addTwoNumbers_v4(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {

    // #DIFF_v3 Supporting negative numbers by removing carryValue > 0 and check iterPtr->val -= -10

    if (!l1 && !l2) // #REVIEW Added after submission to LeetCode
        return nullptr;
        
    ListNode* returnHead = new ListNode();
    ListNode* iterPtr = returnHead;

    char carryValue = 0;
    while (iterPtr)
    {
        iterPtr->val = carryValue;
        carryValue = 0; // Assign 0 for if (... carryValue) check below

        if (l1)
        {
            iterPtr->val += l1->val;
            l1 = l1->next;
        }

        if (l2)
        {
            iterPtr->val += l2->val;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }

        if ((iterPtr->val >= 10) || (iterPtr->val <= -10))
        {
            carryValue = iterPtr->val / 10; // Tens
            iterPtr->val = iterPtr->val % 10; // Ones
        }

        if (l1 || l2 || carryValue) // Another iteration?
        {
            iterPtr->next = new ListNode();
        }
        iterPtr = iterPtr->next;
    }

    return returnHead;
}
```

#### Notes :
LeetCode doesn't want to accept malloc(size) calls over new ListNode(), so that is a performance restraint. Of course the constructor is small, and it is safer to call an object's constructor, but it is not required as I write over garbage data before referencing the garbage. I thought I was being cheeky, but in the end I'll accept the standard of properly newing an object in this exercise as it is good practice overall.

**Carry Over Value**
There are many ways to handle the carry over value...

In recursion, you could call into a lower recursion level function and correct the value recursively if you have a carryValue of !0. That would effectively mean that the 1st call hadnles summing, and the returning level must while(iterPtr) loop over all ->next->val values and increment them until their sum is 1 digit, with the extra carry over being a new value.

In a single-stack function with a while(iterPtr) loop, you can iterate the loop 1 extra time after l1 and l2 are null, to append 1 more node with the carryValue inside, or exit the loop once l1 and l2 have ended and check the carryValue to know if an appended node is needed. ALthough, in practice that's not possible unless we still have a pointer to the last node because iterPtr is null and the list is 1 directional. The returnHead could be walked to find the last node and add 1 more, but creating the node inside the main loop seems better than looping over n nodes after already looping those same n nodes...

**Recursion**
It is possible to call the recursion function 1 more time when l1 and l2 are null if the carryValue is not 0, by creating a new list node to send with the ->val of carryValue. Of course this isn't necessary and the function that finds both l1 and l2 null can create a new in itself and begin the recursion unwind, but it is intersting to think about, if the goal was to abuse recursion as much as possible.

## Conclusion
I feel confident in the speed of my answers, but others seem to have used much less RAM in their solutions. Now I don't know if that's because people "gamed" the system, or if the lower RAM solutions had drastically lower performance, rendering them near-irrelevant, but I would at least like to research other possible solutions to learn more.
