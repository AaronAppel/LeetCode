Given two sorted arraysÂ `nums1`Â andÂ `nums2`Â of sizeÂ `m`Â andÂ `n`Â respectively, returnÂ **the median**Â of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should beÂ `O(log (m+n))`.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
**Output:** 2.00000
**Explanation:** merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
**Output:** 2.50000
**Explanation:** merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m <= 1000`
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`

Additional outputs included in LeetCode testing (failed tests) : 
- \[1, 2\] and \[-1, 3\]
- \[ \] and \[1\]
- \[long list of numbers\] and \[long list of numbers\]
- \[ \] and \[2, 3\]

My Final Solution :

// Submitted 08/2/24 4:14pm
// Runtime#1 of 28ms (50.37%), with RAM usage of 94.66MB (16.30%)
// Runtime#2 of 19ms (89.39%), with RAM usage of 94.77MB (15.59%)
double MedianOfTwoSortedArrays_v2(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2)
{
	// #DIFF_v1 Avoid creating a new vector and use index "pointers" instead.

	int numberOfIterations = (nums1.size() + nums2.size()) * .5 + 1;

	std::vector<int> merged;
	merged.reserve(numberOfIterations);

	int nums1Ptr = 0;
	int nums2Ptr = 0;

	for (size_t i = 0; i < numberOfIterations; ++i)
	{
		if (nums1Ptr >= nums1.size())
		{
			merged.push_back(nums2[nums2Ptr]);
			++nums2Ptr;
		}
		else if (nums2Ptr >= nums2.size())
		{
			merged.push_back(nums1[nums1Ptr]);
			++nums1Ptr;
		}
		else if (nums1[nums1Ptr] < nums2[nums2Ptr])
		{
			merged.push_back(nums1[nums1Ptr]);
			++nums1Ptr;
		}
		else if (nums1[nums1Ptr] >= nums2[nums2Ptr])
		{
			merged.push_back(nums2[nums2Ptr]);
			++nums2Ptr;
		}
	}

	if (merged.empty())
	{
		return 0.;
	}
	else if (merged.size() == 1)
	{
		return merged[0];
	}

	const bool evenNumberOfElements = (nums1.size() + nums2.size()) % 2 == 0;
	if (evenNumberOfElements)
	{
		return (merged[numberOfIterations - 1] + merged[numberOfIterations - 2]) * .5;
	}

	return merged[numberOfIterations - 1];
}

#### Notes :
Sorting algorithms are something I could learn more about. The simple ones, common ones, or whatever. Just more things to learn that should come in handy at some point. This one was tough to think about. A lot of "off by 1" considerations. I'd like to look at the other approaches mentioned in the [editorial section](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/editorial/) of the problem as there are 2 binary search algorithm examples with a lot of insight. They seem pretty involved, so I could come back later. At this point I'd like to solve more problems before re-visiting ones I've solved.

Also, I had forgotten what the "median" was and how to calculate it so that was a good refresher.
