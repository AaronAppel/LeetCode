Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

My Final Solution :
```cpp
bool PalindromeNumber_v1(int x)
{
	const std::string xStr = std::to_string(x);

	const char* left = &xStr[0];
	const char* right = &xStr[xStr.size() - 1];

	for (size_t i = 0; i < xStr.size() / 2; i++)
	{
		if (*left != *right)
		{
			return false;
		}
		++left;
		--right;
	}

	return true;
}
```
#### Notes :
This one felt like the easiest on the site. Immediately after reading the description I had the idea to use 2 pointers and compare the furthest of each side of the number until the pointers met or crossed. Better yet, I reduced the increment range so that check wasn't even needed. Then of course I remembered that I would have to convert eh int to a string which was probably more RAM than necessary, and I went to check the solutions from other people.

I missed the follow up initially but thought I'd try a solution without the std::string. Of course I went on to use std::vector<int> and looped over the digits, appending them as if they were chars. I didn't bother finishing that implementation as it's too similar and I am clearly still thinking about [[7. ☑️ Reverse Integer]] from earlier today.
