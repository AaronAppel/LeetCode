Given an integer `x`, return `true` _if_ `x` _is a_ _**palindrome**__, and_ `false` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 121
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = -121
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 10
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

My Final Solution :
```cpp
bool PalindromeNumber_v2(int x)
{
	// DIFF: No string

	if (x < 0) // #NOTE Could also add (|| x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)
	{
		return false;
	}

	int numDigits = 0;
	int xCopy = x;

	while (xCopy)
	{
		++numDigits;
		xCopy /= 10;
	}

	int left = pow(10, numDigits - 1);

	for (size_t i = 0; i < numDigits / 2; i++)
	{
		int l = x / left;
		int r = x % 10;

		if (l != r)
		{
			return false;
		}

		x = x % left;
		x = x / 10;

		left /= 100;
	}

	return true;
}
```
#### Notes :
This one felt like the easiest on the site. Immediately after reading the description I had the idea to use 2 pointers and compare the furthest of each side of the number until the pointers met or crossed. Better yet, I reduced the increment range so that check wasn't even needed. Then of course I remembered that I would have to convert eh int to a string which was probably more RAM than necessary, and I went to check the solutions from other people.

I missed the follow up initially but thought I'd try a solution without the std::string. Of course I went on to use std::vector<int> and looped over the digits, appending them as if they were chars. I didn't bother finishing that implementation as it's too similar and I am clearly still thinking about [[7. ☑️ Reverse Integer]] from earlier today.
